## My process
For my process making this site I started by designing mobile first and figuring out how to implement bootstrap javascript functions. Once I figured out how to implement javascript functions from the library I was able to make a hamburger menu for the mobile design and dropdown search for the desktop and tablet. I mostly designed the pages in bootstrap but decided it would be easier to make media queries in the supplementary css file. I then finished my site by adding aria roles, skip links, responsive pictures, and other accessability features. I then validated all my code and finsished the project.
## My Challenges
One of the biggest challenges I faced during this project was managing time and figuring out a good order to finish elements of the site in. This lead to me having to go back and change a lot of div's and classes in order to get everything to work properly. I eventually overcame these challenges and now have a better idea on how to budget my time with a project this size.
## What I Learned 
Over the time period I worked on this porject I learned a lot. I think I learned most about how bootstrap actually helps with laying out a site, and the many different features it has. For example it allows you to add javascript functions to your site with ease and really enhance how responsive your site is to different screen sizes.
